# Hey there, I'm Carlos 👋

I’m a web developer with a solid foundation in both frontend and backend. I don't just write code; I focus on building tools that actually work and solve problems. 

I've spent a good amount of time working with **PHP** and **Python** on the server side, while keeping the frontend sharp with **modern JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. I'm comfortable handling databases and making sure data flows correctly via JSON/APIs.

### 🛠 What I work with:
*   **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), PHP, Python.
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Responsive design, layouts).
*   **Backend & Data:** MySQL/PostgreSQL, JSON, REST APIs.
*   **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux environments.

### 💻 What I can build for you:
I’m flexible and can adapt to different project needs, such as:
*   **Web Applications:** Custom-built tools and CRUD systems.
*   **E-commerce & Business sites:** From landing pages to full online stores.
*   **Dashboards:** Internal tools to manage and visualize data.
*   **Backend logic:** Automations with Python or robust server-side scripts with PHP.
